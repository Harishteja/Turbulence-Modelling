In this project, the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is used to numerically solve the governing equations for a fully developed turbulent channel flow using MATLAB. The turbulence closure is modeled using Eddy Viscosity Models, specifically the k–ε and k–ω models. The results are compared with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data from Kim, Moser, and Mansour (1999). MATLAB codes developed for the project are available in the MATLAB Codes folder, and the results are summarized in the reports. A brief explanation of the governing equations, turbulence models, and the FVM discretization is provided below, with detailed discussions available in [2].
